# CalculatePiTheHardWay
Calculate pi the hard way in honor of pi day!

This program randomly generates values and finds if they are coprime.  The probability that this is true is 6/pi^2.  Using math, it can be found what pi is approximately.  

I found the proof from http://www.cut-the-knot.org/m/Probability/TwoCoprime.shtml and from standupmaths youtube video.

##What I found:
The more iterations, the longer it takes but the more accurate is is.

| Iterations    |Pi approximately|
